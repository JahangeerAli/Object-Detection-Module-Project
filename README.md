Object Detection Module Project for Identifying Road Conditions and Turns in Gilgit

This project aims to develop an object detection model for identifying various road conditions and turns in images captured on roads in Gilgit, Pakistan. The primary goal is to enable the model to detect right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected 
road conditions such as landslides. This project provides me with hands-on experience in data gathering, data labeling, Model Selection Training and the implementation of object detection models, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once).
I participated in dataset , data annotating, data cleaning, Preprocessing, model selection, model training.
